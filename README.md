This is a my public repository
This is a my public repository I'm really excited to learn development. Covid-19 has reminded me that life is so precious. I'm constantly inspired to try things I may not have otherwise. I always thought I was too much of a people person to be a developer. I know now and am excited to do both! Challenge accepted!
My favorite food is soup
